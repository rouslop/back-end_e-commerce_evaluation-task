# API e-commerce

This API was developed in Java (JDK 17) with Spring Boot (6.0.12)

## Set up steps

1. Ensure that your computer has installed Maven and Java (JDK 17).
2. Have IntelliJ IDEA installed to run the project.
3. Open the project with it and install Maven Helper plugin (4.26.0).
   - Go to IDE and Project Settings > Plugins > Installed and check if you already have it.
   - If you don't, go to Plugins > Marketplace and search for it as "Maven Helper" and install it.
5. Make right click on the project folder and select Run Maven > clean install to resolve the dependencies.
6. Now you can run the file ECommerceApplication and it will be starting the API on 'http://localhost:8080'.
